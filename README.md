# The Textual Analysis on Fashion Blog Articles Over Time (insert header image)


**Abstract:**

The fashion world is extensive with many layers and processes that are continuously being altered and are morphing to the changing world around it. Trends play a big role in what is being studied in fashion and are the driving factors as to what is created. This raises the questions of how trends change and stay the same, what pieces remain, and what brands rise and fall. Analyzing around 2,000 blog articles from the early 2010’s can help provide answers and a glimpse in the ever changing fashion industry. Seeing the repetition of pieces such as skinny jeans or leggings and brands like Marc Jacobs describe the trends of this timeframe. Presenting textual findings in a variety of graphs easily reveal what was mentioned and what trends died. It displayed how fast society moves from each trend. Even though clothes seem like a small part of society, it emphasizes the thinking of the field of fashion and its consumers.
